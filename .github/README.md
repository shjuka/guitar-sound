Here’s a high-level plan to get you started with your Python project for guitar note detection:

1. **Scaffold a Python "Hello World" project** in your current workspace.
2. **Install required libraries** for audio recording and note detection (e.g., `sounddevice`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `librosa`).
3. **Create a script** that:
    - Records audio from your microphone.
    - Processes the audio to extract the fundamental frequency.
    - Maps the frequency to a guitar note.
4. **Add a `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** for workspace-specific Copilot guidance.
5. **Create a README.md** with instructions.
6. **Set up a VS Code task** for running your script.

**Next step:**  
I will scaffold a basic Python project and set up the initial files. Then, I’ll guide you on installing the necessary libraries and writing the first script to record and analyze guitar notes.

Would you like to proceed with the default "Hello World" Python setup and install the recommended libraries for audio processing?

pip install sounddevice numpy scipy librosa
